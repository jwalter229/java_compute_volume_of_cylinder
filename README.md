#Compute Volume of Cylinder

Write a Java porgram to compute the volume of a cylinder. The program should take in the radius and length from the user, and compute the area and volume using the area and volume formulas.

/*compute the volume of a cylinder
write  a program that reads in the radius and
length of a cylinder and computes the area
and volume using the following formulas
   area = radius * radius * 3.14
   volume =  area * length
